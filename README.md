I have created a role-playing game called "Kingdoms of Dungeons". In this game, you can create your own character by choosing from four classes: Warrior, Rogue, Hunter or Mage. Each class has its own skills and statistics.

Once you have your character, you can see their stats and a description of their class. You can also go to the in-game store to purchase equipment such as swords, shields, bows, and more, using gold you have available.

The game has a main menu where you can create a character, view your character, go to the store, check your inventory, or exit the game. It's a fun way to explore different characters and manage your resources in the game.
